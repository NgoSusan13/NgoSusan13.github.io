<h2>Description of Project</h2>

<p>
Our goal was to recreate a soundbite beats app where users can select buttons on the app associated with a specific sound and then play the beats selected. Users have the option of selecting a specific beat provided by the program and the number of times for the soundbites to loop through. The purpose of recreating this app is utilize COMP 110 concepts to create a user-friendly app for people to produce music easily.

<h2 style="margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 50px;" >COMP 110 Programming Concepts Used</h2>


<ul>
<li>2D-Array was used to associated each cell (tile) of the array with a specific sound in the form of mp3, so when the button is toggled, the sound assigned to the tile will be played.
</li>
<li>
If-else statements were used for several purposes in this program. One of the main use of this concept was to create conditions where the program would recognize if the buttons are toggled or not, and if so it would follow through with a specific set of code, and vice versa.
</li>
<li>
Map Interface with HashMap class was used to store the tile associated with a specific sound (value) with its corresponding button (keys) that was created in SceneBuilder.
</li>
<li>
For loops was also used multiple times in the program. One of the main use of this concept was to ask the program to loop through each cell in the 2D array to see which button was toggled and then play the sound in increment order
</li>
<li>
Simple variable types and classes were used to define types of variables.
</li>
<li>
Classes had fields, constructors, and methods. Arguments and parameters were used with the complex commas and whatnot. They look so much more legit when there are multiple parameters.
</li>
<li>
Classes used return types matching the type returned (ofc). We used setter and getter methods.
</li>
<li>
We used ==, <=, !, etc. for boolean if-thens as well as the this.(method) for calling methods within a class on the same object.
</li>
<li>
We “learned” how to use applications. By that, I mean we learned how to apply boilerplate code, which is super confusing but easy to find via the magic of Google.
</li>
<li>
More importantly, we learned the infinite power of StackOverflow and how to use the internet to find methods we would have no way of otherwise knowing.
</li>
<li>
Classes were used and put in different files so we could test them individually in the main method with de-bugging code i.e. System.out.println(“sound 1”).
</li>
<li>
  Files from outside the package were imported via the all-important “right-click” method on the irl.mouse tool whenever we copied unknown methods from StackOverflow that resulted in the scary red squigglies.
</li>
<li>
FXML and scenebuilder were used to create the application. Apparently it was hecka easier to use scenebuilder than to build it from scratch, so that was awesome. It was like using paint.
</li>
</ul>

<h2> Challenges Overcome/ New Concepts Learned </h2>

<p>
Throughout this project, we ran into a couple of challenges with the audio, mainly because we've never worked with audio before duirng class. For this particular app, we needed to figure out a code that will allow us to pull the mp3 files from a folder and play it when the button associated with the mp3 is toggled. In addition to this, we learned a lot of concepts in relation to how to code html and css in order to report our project on the GitHub page.

<h2>Individual Contributions to the Project</h2>

<h3 >Soham Amin</h3>
<p>
Introduced the idea of creating a soundbite program similar to the Auxy app from the Apple Store. Also, coded majority of the Boots n Cats program, which included creating the mp3 files, coding the TileController, TileRunner, BeatKeeper, etc. This enabled the program not only to set and get specific mp3 files associated with a button, but also allowed program to loop through the beats once the play button was pressed.
</p>
<h3>Aaron Lee</h3>
<p>
Contributed to coding the Boots n Cats program and exported the program as a runnable jar file so it can be pushed into GitHub. In addition, Aaron helped with majority of GitKraken and Atom program so that project summary can be displayed on GitHub web.
</p>
<h3>Susan Ngo</h3>

<h2>Goals Achieved</h2>
<p>
From this Boots n Cats program, we were able to create a running program where mp3 files are embedded into a 8 by 6 2D array and can be prompted to execute a set of methods depending on if the buttons are toggled or untoggled. Additionally, users can ask program to play specific beats, loops a specific number of times, and run at certain speed before play button is pressed. Overall, this project challenged us to utilize the 2D-Array and Maps concept we have learned in COMP 110 lecture to recreate this soundbite app.

</p>

<h2>Goals Outstanding/Future Work</h2>
<p>
Although we were able to get the program running, there is still a lot of room for improvement, including adding more audio options into the app, synchronizing the beats so the vertical tiles are played all at once, improving the audio quality when the app is ran multiple times, etc. In order to achieve these goals, we would have to seek for other resources to help fine tune some of the codes and add other methods to carry out desired function.

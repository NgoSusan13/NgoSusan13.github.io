Description of Project
</h2>
<p>
Our goal was to recreate a soundbite beats app where users can select buttons on the app associated with a specific sound and then play the beats selected. Users have the option of selecting a specific beat provided by the program and the number of times for the soundbites to loop through. The purpose of recreating this app is utilize COMP 110 concepts to create a user-friendly app for people to produce music easily.

COMP 110 Programming Concepts Used
</h2>
<p>
2D-Array was used to associated each cell (tile) of the array with a specific sound in the form of mp3, so when the button is toggled, the sound assigned to the tile will be played.
</p>
<p>
If-else statements were used for several purposes in this program. One of the main use of this concept was to create conditions where the program would recognize if the buttons are toggled or not, and if so it would follow through with a specific set of code, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
Map Interface with HashMap class was used to store the tile associated with a specific sound (value) with its corresponding button (keys) that was created in SceneBuilder.
</p>
<p>
For loops was also used multiple times in the program. One of the main use of this concept was to ask the program to loop through each cell in the 2D array to see which button was toggled and then play the sound in increment order

Individual Contributions to the Project
</h2>
<h3>
Soham Amin
</h3>
<p>
Introduced the idea of creating a soundbite program similar to the Auxy app from the Apple Store. Also, coded majority of the Boots n Cats program, which included creating the mp3 files, coding the TileController, TileRunner, BeatKeeper, etc. This enabled the program not only to set and get specific mp3 files associated with a button, but also allowed program to loop through the beats once the play button was pressed.

<h3>
Aaron Lee
</h3>
<p>
Contributed to coding the Boots n Cats program and exported the program as a runnable jar file so it can be pushed into GitHub. In addition, Aaron helped with majority of GitKraken and Atom program so that project summary can be displayed on GitHub web.

<h2>
Goals Achieved
</h2>
<p>
From this Boots n Cats program, we were able to create a running program where mp3 files are embedded into a 4 by 3 2D array and can be prompted to execute a set of methods depending on if the buttons are toggled or untoggled. Additionally, users can ask program to play specific beats and loop a specific number of times before play button is pressed. Overall, this project challenged us to utilize the 2D-Array and Maps concept we have learned in COMP 110 lecture to recreate this soundbite app.

<h2>
Goals Outstanding/Future Work
</h2>
<p>
Although we were able to get the program running, there is still a lot of room for improvement, including adding more audio options into the app, synchronizing the beats so the vertical tiles are played all at once, improving the audio quality when the app is ran multiple times, etc. In order to achieve these goals, we would have to seek for other resources to help fine tune some of the codes and add other methods to carry out desired function.
